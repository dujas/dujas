# üí´ About Me:

I‚Äôm a fullstack developer with 9+ years of experience. My main backend stack has been Node.js/Express/MongoDB, while on the frontend, I‚Äôve worked extensively with React, though I also used Angular for a few years.  
One of my primary goals is to transition into full-time Rust development and focus on projects that leverage **Rust/React** stacks.

## What Am I Currently Working On?

### Rust CLI - A Simple Password Manager

This is a command-line tool that allows users to securely store their passwords locally using AES-256 encryption, protected by a master password. Future steps include synchronizing encrypted files with cloud storage. Ultimately, I plan to build a minimalistic but secure web server, enabling users to access their credentials from anywhere on any device. You can more find more details in this repository (_Coming soon_).

### Rust E-commerce REST API

The goal of this project is to create a boilerplate REST API for e-commerce applications. It will support SQL databases like PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB or AWS DynamoDB. You can more find more details in this repository (_Coming soon_).

### React Timeboxing App

Timeboxing is a frontend application designed to help users prioritize their tasks before organizing them into a daily schedule.

- The app is a work in progress and will initially be a Progressive Web App (PWA) that stores user data in the browser cache, eliminating the need for a backend.

You can find more details about its architecture, roadmap, and goals, along with the source code, in the project repository (_Coming soon_).

### XYOM - Online Morphometrics

I am also involved in an international voluntary project in collaboration with universities and scientific institutions worldwide. This initiative led to the creation of [XYOM](https://xyom.io), a platform I co-founded and developed from scratch, continue to maintain in production. [More info in this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30794886/).

Our main sponsor is the [IRD (Research Institute for Development)](https://en.ird.fr/), and we collaborate with universities in Argentina, Colombia, Thailand, France, and C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. These institutions have contributed data and feedback to improve the tools and user experience of the application.

[XYOM](https://xyom.io) is a web application providing free, comprehensive tools for research in the scientific field of **geometric morphometrics**. It offers:

- A user-friendly interface for 2D image digitization and landmark capture.
- A wide range of multivariate statistical analyses for tasks like characterization, identification, and complementary analyses.

I focus primarily on the technical aspects of XYOM. The stack includes Node.js and React, uses Terraform and AWS for its cloud resources and CI/CD pipelines. Also, the project is transitioning to Rust. More details about this transition, along with the technical architecture, can be found in [here](projects/xyom/index.md).

The scientific part of XYOM is led by Dr. Jean-Pierre Dujardin. You can learn more about his work [here](http://xyom-clic.eu/).

Lastly, XYOM will gradually become open-source as we complete its transition from Node.js to Rust. You can find some information [here](projects/xyom/index.md)
